# WASD - We Are Surely Developers! 🦈 
## (A tribute to all the Blahaj fans out there!)

## 💡Inspiration :

How tiring can your day get being a developer? Well it takes a humongous amount of time and committment levels to be able to handles all the bugs that come your way, resolve them and make the code work!
 

Well, this weekend let's take time to support all the developers around the globe relieve stress and have some action packed fun by playing some cool games. 

## ⚓ What it does :
Well, this project contains 3 different games that you can play and have fun this weekend!
#### 1. Coffee with Blahaj. ☕
Blahaj + Bugs? well a rare combination in the real world but not in the world of Developers. Grab a cup of coffee with Blahaj and escape bugs with us in this game.
#### 2. Blahaj in the Maze. 👻
Are you stuck in a cubicle where you endlessly code all day? Well even Blahaj is stuck in a maze, help it get out by finding the key!
#### 3. Swimmy Blahaj. 💣
Do you get called in the middle of the night for last moment code fixes? As if a bomb dropped over your head? Well help Blahaj stay away from such bombs and keep flapping.


 ## 🛠️ How we built it :
We built a simple landing page using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. We made a basic game first and built on it by adding two more games.

We primarily used the Kaboom js which is a javascript game programming library and Replit for asset loading to build the games.



## 💪Challenges we ran into :
Well, we ran into multiple issues while building this project, a few of them are:

    - Not being able to understand bundlers inorder combine multiple js files.
    - Not being able to figure out how to render the games Replit.
    - Difficulty in integrating Auth0 for user authentication as it was our first time using it.

## 📌 Accomplishments that we're proud of :
Finally, we were able to build something that relieves stress out of developers and reminds them that it is equally important to spend time for themselves and have some fun!

## 📚 What we learned :
- We learned using Kaboom js as this was our first attempt to build a game using it.
- We learned a few basic things about React as we had no clue about it priorly.
- We got to learn using Auth0 for user authentication.
- We also got to learn the fact that "You need to spend some time having fun" as a developer.
- We learned how rapid development tools can save a lot of your time instead of hard coding everything.
## ⏭ What's next for WASD? :
- User profiles and database where the users can check the high scores for the games they played.
- We initially thought of building the project in such a way that the game displays resources for developers in different domains immediately after the game ends. So we will figure a way out to do this.
